Keeps track of works you've read on Archive of Our Own in a Google Sheet

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file using the example file [.env.example](.env.example)
2. Download a `service-account.json` with access to your Google Sheet

## Usage

Run `deno task add` to be prompted to enter Archive of Our Own work URLs (ex: https://archiveofourown.org/works/XXXXXXXX or https://archiveofourown.org/works/XXXXXXXX/chapters/XXXXXXXX) space-separated

If you put a url with a specific chapter, it will still grab the whole work word count so both kinds of URLs will work the same
